    <h1>HTML Concepts</h1>
    <h3>WWW</h3>
<p>The <em>World Wide Web</em> in simple terms is a set of several documents which are interlinked and 
can be accessed via the internet. HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> is most commonly used document type in the 
World Wide Web. Major pieces of World Wide Web include <b>A user, Browser plus computer, Internet and Servers.</b> 
</p>

<p> The user sends a request from the computer via a browser to the servers using a protocol call <em> 
HTTP </em> and the server responds to these requests by sending documents like HTML documents that the browser 
displays
</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>

<p> HTML is made up of the following 4 pieces <br>
  1) Text Content <br>
  2) <em>Mark up </em> <br>
  3) <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-
48480496">References to other documents like this video</a><br>
  4) <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Links to other pages like this webpage </a> <br>
</p>

<h3>HTML Tags</h3>

<p> HTML Elements also known as <b>tags</b> are the key components of <em>Hyper Text Markup 
Language.</em> Usually an element starts with an opening tag, closes with a closing tag and includes the contents to be dispayed in between the tags. 
The tags specify how the contents are seen on the web page.
</p>
<p>
<b><em>Break Tag</em></b><br>There are some tags that do not include a closing tag. <br> <em>For 
eg:</em> A break tag that breaks a sentence into 2 separate lines <br> Line A <br> Line B 
<br>
<b><em>Anchor Tag</em></b> <br>
Some tags have attributes. <em><br>For eg:</em> Anchor tag uses attribute which is used for making <a 
href="http://www.udacity.com">links</a>
<br>
<b><em>Span and Div Tags</em></b>
These tags include ways to attach styles to the content to adjust the way text works. The major difference 
between these 2 tagsis that <em>Span tag</em>
is an inline element while <em> dive tag</em> is a block element. A block element creates an invisible 
block around the content unline inline element.
